# Linux Gaming Utils

The goal of this site is having a list with several tools, such as drivers and gaming oriented programs like wheels, joysticks and mice configurators and such.

This project is under the GNU/GPL 3 license and everybody is welcomed to help to add new entries to the list.

### Howto add a new utility or driver:

To add a new utility or driver you must follow these steps:

* Go to **_data** folder on the repo. This folder is the one that contains the files with the data of what it shows me on the web. In it you will see a file, _template.yml, that you can use as a template, or use [this form](https://linux-gaming-tools.github.io/form) for make the file easily.
* Click on **Create new file** and copy the content of _template.yml and edit the variables, or copy the result of the form. The name of the file can only have lowercase letters, numbers underscores (\_) and minus (-), and the extension .yml.
* At the end of the page fill the fields and press **Propose new file**. This generates automatically a new pull request.
* And that's it Once your contribution has been reviewed the request will be accepted and will automatically appear on the web ;)
* You can also fork the project, make your changes and make a pull request, although this method is slower, but it can be worth it if you are going to make many contributions, or include changes in the rest of the project.
